# ArduinoMashController
Arduino (Uno or Nano) based Mash and Brew Controller
Code for controlling both a Homebrew HLT and Mash HX with a pretty GUI.

If using the Arduino IDE, these files need to be in a directory named "_20A_Kettle_Controller"


It's dependant on a bunch of arduino libraries, and specific hardware.
Most are run-of-the-mill standard, but there's also the PDQ_GFX library:

A copy of this library and all necessary others is included in this repository, some with minor modification.
These can be found under Libraries/
